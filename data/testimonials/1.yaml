text: "I had the privilege of working with Shahbaz on a custom project. The project was challenging and to some extent it had come to a stop before Shahbaz was thankfully assigned to it. Shahbaz loves challenging problems, and he does not sit idle until he finds a solution to address them. Shahbaz is motivated, ambitious and hungry to learn and hungry to solve. Any organization is lucky to have Shahbaz as a member of its staff."
